# Kruskal-Tree
This program is designed to illustrate the process of finding the minimum cost to connect all cities in a graph using Kruskal's algorithm, which is particularly efficient for sparse graphs. The graph is statically defined, and the code demonstrates basic memory management, graph traversal, and union-find techniques in C.
